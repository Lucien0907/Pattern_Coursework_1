# Report
1) Do not copy standard formulas from lecture notes, explain algorithms in detail, or copy figures from other sources. References to lecture slides or publications/webpages are enough in such cases, however short explanations of new terms or parameters referred to are needed. 

2) Select relevant results that support the points you want to make rather than everything that python/matlab gives. 

3) The important results should be in the report, not just in the appendix. 

4) The experiments should be described such that there is no ambiguity in the settings, protocol and metrics used.

5) The main points are made clear, identifying the best and the worst case results or other important observations. 

6) Find and demonstrate the parameters that lead to optimal performance and validate it by presenting supporting results. 

7) Give insights, discussions, and reasons behind your answers. Quality and completeness of discussions within the page limit will be marked. Include formulas where appropriate, results presented in figures, and their discussions.
